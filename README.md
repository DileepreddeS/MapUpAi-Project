Antd is intended to be used in conjunction with a build tool, such as webpack, which will make it easy to import only the parts of antd that We are using.

React uses Redux for building the user interface. React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data.
Redux helps apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model. React Redux is conceptually simple.
It subscribes to the Redux store, checks to see if the data which our component wants have changed, and re-renders our component.

Turfjs is an open-source JavaScript library used for spatial analysis. It includes All spatial operations, helper functions for creating GeoJSON data, and data classification and statistics tools Etc..

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, open geographic database updated and maintained by a community of volunteers via open collaboration. Contributors collect data from surveys, trace from aerial imagery and also import from other freely licensed geodata sources.We will get the Json Data of a Country And we Can Use it By Calling Api's.

osmtogeojson is a Javascript module for converting OSM data (OSM XML or Overpass JSON) to GeoJSON. It works in the browser, nodejs and can also be used as a command line tool.


Leaflet is the open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.In This React Application We are Using LeafLet Library Also Which Is Used For Re-rendering the map from the Geolocation Data Whatever Giver by the User.

Axios is a promise-based HTTP library that lets developers make requests to either their own or a third-party server to fetch data. It offers different ways of making requests such as GET , POST , PUT/PATCH , and DELETE .
